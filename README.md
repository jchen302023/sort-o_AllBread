#### BubbleSort 
* Best Case Scenario
  * Array ordered from least to greatest 
  * This scenario creates the least number of swaps (0) 
  * Requires 20 comparisons, which is the same across all types of cases for arrays of length 5 
* Worst Case Scenario
  * Array ordered from greatest to least
  * This scenario creates the most number of swaps (10)
* We tested an array with unordered numbers. The number of swaps required was between the swaps neccessary for the best and worse cases which goes to show that there is a distinct best and worse case for BubbeSort
#### InsertionSort
* Best Case Scenario
* Worst Case Scenario
